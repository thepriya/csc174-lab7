					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>When Kevin was four years old, he had severe pneumonia, for which he stayed in the ICU for two weeks. When he was seven, he had an asthma attack on the running track during elementary school. Kevin was taken to the ER to be treated with a nebulizer. In both cases, he would not have survived without the care of doctors, nurses, parents, and more importantly, the advanced medical technology that made treatment possible. Since then, he was determined to improve human life with technology. Technology has saved his life twice.</p>
					<p>There are many ways that technology can change people’s life. Elon Musk, an entrepreneur who has led the space exploration effort by launching advanced rockets, arguably saved Mother Earth by reducing the fuel usage with electric cars, and envisioned Hyperloop as a fifth transportation whose speed is faster than airline speed, which could significantly reduce travel time. Or consider Mark Zuckerberg, a visionary who with his team has brought people together with the world’s biggest social network and designed a giant drone “Aquila” to make the internet accessible to distant areas. Kevin aspires to become a successful engineer and entrepreneur like them and impact our world positively!</p>

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>As the pioneer institution in advanced research and innovation, Hajim School of Engineering will be the perfect place for his exploratory journey to become a great engineer. He would be able to expose himself to the many different fields of engineering by taking advantage of the wide selection of courses and learning from the world-class faculty at the School of Engineering. While the exceptional academic program will prepare him with a solid knowledge foundation, the abundant research and internship opportunities would allow him to apply and experiment the knowledge alongside with prominent professors and industry leaders.</p>
					<p>As the founder of Math Team and member of Engineering Club at his high school, he created a supportive learning environment to tackle interesting math problems and build robots outside of the classroom with peers who shared the same passion. He enjoys putting ideas into actions and learning through peer-led collaboration. Kevin was excited when he learned about hackathons, a platform for programmers to collaborate with each other and create an interesting project under twenty-four hours! Kevin and his friend went to the hackathon at Syracuse University last semester, and, although the result was not ideal, they made several friends there and gained tons of fun and excitements! He firmly believes that those two days that they spent there were worthwhile for his mundane freshman year.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>When Kevin thinks of the University of Rochester, he thinks of thousands of patients such as himself who has or may suffer from potentially fatal infections or acute asthma attacks. He thinks of the technology-enabled medical techniques that literally saved millions of lives. He thinks of an inspiration-filled atmosphere that perpetually battles at the forefront of breakthrough innovation. And he thinks of a world-class institution where he believes would be the best place for him to study as an engineer and as a leader, allowing him to be bold to dream and to be strong to lead!</p>

					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>Lingling comes from Shanghai, China, which is a modern and beautiful city. The place she misses the most is the park near her kindergarten. When she was age 4 when most ofher peers had attended the kindergarten and started their "academic year". Lingling, on the other hand was still playing or in other words "studying"at home. Her parents think that family education is better for a young kid than attending the class in the kindergarten, although the "family education"is not as popular in China as in America. She thanks her parents a lot for letting her have this experience.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>For her academic career: she might return to China and work for some years. After she gains some savings and accumulate some life experience, she might return to school again. She might go to more countries to finish her graduate education. She plans to stay in Australia, England, German to have her graduate education. She believes the time being a student is the happiest time in life for you to enjoy the world, enjoy the travel and enjoy the knowledge. After the graduate school, she might return to work for several years, and might try to start her own business.</p>
					<p>She had taken almost all pre-request course of her major. Among all of the classes, JPN101 is her favorite class. She tried to maintain her class credits with in 24, but there have too much interesting stuff she wants to have a try in the college, so she overloads again. Lingling hopes she can succeed in this year’s academic study. the campus and acted as a student leader on behalf on the "social sprit”.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>Lingling loves to play the piano and is currently taking lessons in Eastman music school. She started to learn piano (as well as her painting) when she was in Kindergarten. Yes! Kindergarten again! But it was not until she attended the piano lesson in Eastman, did she start to love playing the piano. The teacher in Eastman simply overturned everything she thought She knew about the piano and how to practice the piano. "You must think the piano as an assembled collection of instruments”, her teacher said. She started to explore the unique tone quality of different region on the keyboard, and that makes me really excited. Just imagine! You can play as a band while you are just actually playing the single instrument!</p>
					<p>Besides the piano, Lingling is also trying to explore her skill's possibility! She loves painting and designing and has an internship this summer as a graphic designer in a Fin-tech company. For the sports, she love play badminton, and successfully managed to realize her goal settled at the beginning of last semester to cover 4 hours of sports every week. This semester, she wants to explore the dancing area! She registered the "Rice Crew"club to have a taste of K-pop dancing. She is also trying to do something for the community. She passed the elections to be a D'Lion this year on Gate 6 and Gannett 6, aiming to help the first-year students move into the campus and acted as a student leader on behalf on the "social sprit”.</p>

					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>Valerie has done a variety of work, both as a volunteer and as a paid employee. Her first job was at Mini Ivy Tutoring Center, where she tutored elementary and middle school students in math and English. In addition, she performed various office administrative duties, such as keeping track of attendance and picking up phone calls. </p>
					<p>In the summer of 2015, she participated in Girls Who Code’s Summer Immersion Program, where she was introduced to computer science. She learned how to code in JavaScript, Python, and HTML. Besides gaining technical skills, she was able to connect with female engineers and entrepreneurs, and hear their stories about what it’s like to work in a tech company. The program also gave her the opportunity to visit different tech companies, such as Google and Microsoft. For the final project, she created a user-friendly online app using HTML and JavaScript to locate and post about volunteer services.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>The easiest classes that Valerie has taken here at the University of Rochester are CSC170, PSY101 and CHI102. She was able to deepen her knowledge of creating and designing web pages with CSC170. The concepts in PSY101 were not difficult to understand and the mini courses throughout the semester made the class more interesting. CHI102 was not a difficult course, but it required a lot of work and practice every day to understand the vocabulary and grammar concepts.</p>
					<p>The harder classes include BIO110 and CHM131. For her, BIO110 was more difficult because it focused mainly on the molecular level of biology. CHM131 was fine until she started to learn about acids and titrations. Another class that was intense was MTH162. Even though the AP exam gave her a good foundation, a lot of the topics were difficult to understand, such as series.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>In 2016, Valerie interned with the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence’s Asian Youth in Action program. As an intern, she worked with the Chinatown Tenants Union to help tenants challenge evictions and harassment from their landlords. She also interpreted for rent stabilized tenants sharing their stories at hearings to fight for a rent freeze. Working at this organization allowed her to realize that striving for a collective goal is not only necessary, but can also make housing justice for low income residents a reality.</p>
					<p>For the past two years, Valerie has been an intern at the American Museum of Natural History’s ornithology department. She conducted library and laboratory research on the genetic diversity of European starlings. The goal of the project was to determine if there were any distinct genetic differences between the European starlings of North America and their parent population. The research included extracting DNA from the flesh of the bird specimens and amplifying mitochondrial DNA from the birds. In addition, she used a bioinformatics software called Geneious to analyze and edit the DNA sequences. The program culminated in a research presentation at a symposium session.</p>
