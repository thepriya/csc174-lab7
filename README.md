Description of information architecture:

### Ontology:
The three students whose data is used for this lab are 
Lingling Li 
Valerie Tam
Kevin Kao

In the index page, each student's section follows the same outline, that is, the student's name followed by their picture. This is followed by a short description and at the end it the link to the original website of the student. The relationships are obvious between the students.

In the subpage, the outline is similar for each student. The name and picture come first followed by three sub-headings for each student. The subheadings did not originally match. The original content was rearranged and refocused to make the pattern consistent. The style and content are similar in design (a subheading with one or two paragraphs of content).



### Taxonomy: 
The index page has obvious headings. Each student has a section which starts with the student's name and contains a paragraph about the student.

In the subpage, the three headings that are used are:

* About : This gives a brief overview of the background of the student.
* Education : This section contains the courses that a student has taken.
* Interests : The interests and description of the student's interests is explained in this section.



### Choreography: 

The odd student out is Kevin as the other two students are female students and Kevin is not. Kevin is the first student mentioned and the different style indicates this. He is at the top of the list to make it stand out that he is the odd student.

The students are arranged in alphabetical order of their first name. The subpage follows the order of details in the chronological order that would follow if it was told in the form of a story.
