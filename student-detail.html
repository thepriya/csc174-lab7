					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>When I was four years old, I had severe pneumonia, for which I stayed in the ICU for two weeks. When I was seven, I had an asthma attack on the running track during elementary school. I was taken to the ER to be treated with a nebulizer. In both cases, I would not have survived without the care of doctors, nurses, parents, and more importantly, the advanced medical technology that made treatment possible. Since then, I was determined to improve human life with technology. Technology has saved my life twice.</p>
					<p>There are many ways that technology can change people’s life. Elon Musk, an entrepreneur who has led the space exploration effort by launching advanced rockets, arguably saved Mother Earth by reducing the fuel usage with electric cars, and envisioned Hyperloop as a fifth transportation whose speed is faster than airline speed, which could significantly reduce travel time. Or consider Mark Zuckerberg, a visionary who with his team has brought people together with the world’s biggest social network and designed a giant drone “Aquila” to make the internet accessible to distant areas. I aspire to become a successful engineer and entrepreneur like them and impact our world positively!</p>

					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>As the pioneer institution in advanced research and innovation, Hajim School of Engineering will be the perfect place for my exploratory journey to become a great engineer. I would expose myself to the many different fields of engineering by taking advantage of the wide selection of courses and learning from the world-class faculty at the School of Engineering. While the exceptional academic program will prepare me with a solid knowledge foundation, the abundant research and internship opportunities would allow me to apply and experiment the knowledge alongside with prominent professors and industry leaders.</p>
					<p>As the founder of Math Team and member of Engineering Club at my high school, I created a supportive learning environment to tackle interesting math problems and build robots outside of the classroom with peers who shared the same passion. I enjoy putting ideas into actions and learning through peer-led collaboration. I was excited when I have learned about hackathon, a platform for programmers to collaborate with each other and create an interesting project under twenty-four hours! My friend and I went to the hackathon at Syracuse University last semester, and, although the result was not ideal, I made several friends there and gained tons of fun and excitements! I firmly believe that those two days we spent there were worthwhile for my mundane freshman year.</p>

					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>When I think of the University of Rochester, I think of thousands of patients such as myself who has or may suffer from potentially fatal infections or acute asthma attacks. I think of the technology-enabled medical techniques that literally saved millions of lives. I think of an inspiration-filled atmosphere that perpetually battles at the forefront of breakthrough innovation. And I think of a world-class institution where I believe would be the best place for me to study as an engineer and as a leader, allowing me to be bold to dream and to be strong to lead!</p>

					<h3>Childhood</h3>
					<p>I come from Shanghai, China, which is a modern and beautiful city. The place I missed their most is the park near my kindergarten. When I was age 4 when most of my peer had attended the kindergarten and start their "academic year", I on the other hand was still playing or in other words "studying"at home. My parents think that family education is better for a young kid than attending the class in the kindergarten, although the "family education"is not as popular in China as in America. I thank my parents a lot for letting me have this experience.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
					<p>I love to play the piano and is currently taking lessons in Eastman music school. I started to learn piano (as well as my painting) when I was in Kindergarten. Yes! Kindergarten again! But it was not until I attend the piano lesson in Eastman, did I start to love playing the piano. The teacher in Eastman simply overturned everything I thought I knew about the piano and how to practice the piano. "You must think the piano as an assembled collection of instruments”, my teacher said. I started to explore the unique tone quality of different region on the keyboard, and that makes me really excited. Just imagine! You can play as a band while you are just actually playing the single instrument!</p>
					<p>Besides the piano, I'm also trying to explore my skill's possibility! I love painting and designing and have an intern this summer as a graphic designer in a Fin-tech company. For the sports, I love play badminton, and successfully managed to realize my goal settled at the beginning of last semester to cover 4 hours of sports every week. This semester, I want to explore the dancing area! I registered the "Rice Crew"club to have a taste of K-pop dancing. I'm also trying to do something for the community. I passed the elections to be a D'Lion this year on Gate 6 and Gannett 6, aiming to help the first-year students move into the campus and acted as a student leader on behalf on the "social sprit”.</p>

					<h3>Academic Interest</h3>
					<p>For my academic career: I might return to China and work for some years. After I gain some savings and accumulate some life experience, I might return to school again. I might go to more countries to finish my graduate education. I plan to stay in Australia, England, German to have my graduate education. I believe the time being a student is the happiest time in life for you to enjoy the world, enjoy the travel and enjoy the knowledge. After the graduate school, I might return to work for several years, and might try to start my own business.</p>
					<p>I had taken almost all pre-request course of my major. Among all of the classes, JPN101 is my favorite class. I tried to maintain my class credits with in 24, but there have too much interesting stuff I want to have a try in the college, so I overload again. I hope I can succeed in this year’s academic study. the campus and acted as a student leader on behalf on the "social sprit”.</p>

					<h3>Initial employment</h3>
					<p>	My first job was at Mini Ivy Tutoring Center, where I tutored elementary and middle school students in math and English. In addition, I performed various office administrative duties, such as keeping track of attendance and picking up phone calls. </p>
					<p>In the summer of 2015, I participated in Girls Who Code’s Summer Immersion Program, where I was introduced to computer science. I learned how to code in JavaScript, Python, and HTML. Besides gaining technical skills, I was able to connect with female engineers and entrepreneurs, and hear their stories about what it’s like to work in a tech company. The program also gave me the opportunity to visit different tech companies, such as Google and Microsoft. For the final project, I created a user-friendly online app using HTML and JavaScript to locate and post about volunteer services.</p>

					<h3>Internships</h3>
					<p>	In 2016, I interned with the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence’s Asian Youth in Action program. As an intern, I worked with the Chinatown Tenants Union to help tenants challenge evictions and harassment from their landlords. I also interpreted for rent stabilized tenants sharing their stories at hearings to fight for a rent freeze. Working at this organization allowed me to realize that striving for a collective goal is not only necessary, but can also make housing justice for low income residents a reality.</p>
					<p>For the past two years, I’ve been an intern at the American Museum of Natural History’s ornithology department. I conducted library and laboratory research on the genetic diversity of European starlings. The goal of the project was to determine if there were any distinct genetic differences between the European starlings of North America and their parent population. The research included extracting DNA from the flesh of the bird specimens and amplifying mitochondrial DNA from the birds. In addition, I used a bioinformatics software called Geneious to analyze and edit the DNA sequences. The program culminated in a research presentation at a symposium session.</p>

					<h3>Courses</h3>
					<p>	The easiest classes that I’ve taken here at the University of Rochester are CSC170, PSY101 and CHI102. I was able to deepen my knowledge of creating and designing web pages with CSC170. The concepts in PSY101 were not difficult to understand and the mini courses throughout the semester made the class more interesting. CHI102 was not a difficult course, but it required a lot of work and practice every day to understand the vocabulary and grammar concepts.</p>
					<p>The harder classes include BIO110 and CHM131. For me, BIO110 was more difficult because it focused mainly on the molecular level of biology. CHM131 was fine until I started to learn about acids and titrations. Another class that was intense was MTH162. Even though the AP exam gave me a good foundation, a lot of the topics were difficult to understand, such as series.</p>
